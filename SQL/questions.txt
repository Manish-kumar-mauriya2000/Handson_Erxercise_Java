1. Modifications to data are allowed on tables only during normal office hours 
of 9:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m., i.e. Monday through Friday.
Create a stored procedure called RESTRICT_DML that prevents the DML 
statements from executing outside of normal office hours, returning an 
alert message, “You may make changes only during normal business 
hours.”
2. Create a statement trigger on the NEW_EMP table that calls the above 
procedure.
3. Employee should receive an automatic increase in salary if the minimum 
salary for a job is increased. Implement this requirement through a trigger 
on the JOBS table.
a. Create a stored procedure named UPD_EMP_SAL to update the 
salary amount. This procedure accepts two parameters: the job ID for 
which salary has to be updated and the new minimum salary for this 
job ID. This procedure is executed from the trigger on the JOBS table.
b. Create a row trigger named UPDATE_EMP_SALARY on the JOBS table 
that invokes the procedure UPD_EMP_SAL when the minimum salary 
in the JOBS table is updated for a specified job ID .
c. Query the EMPS table to see the current salary for employees who 
are programmers.
d. Increase the minimum salary for the programmer job from 20,000 to 
25,000.
4. Create a trigger for the DEPT table so that whatever a row is deleted from 
it, the corresponding rows of EMPS table are also deleted
